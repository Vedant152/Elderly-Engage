This prototype aims to facilitate social interaction and enable elderly individuals to participate in health-related events.

They must first create an account on the platform.
Once they've registered, they can visit the explore section to view all of the scheduled details for an upcoming event.They can then sign up to attend that event from there. The event could be related to health care, but it could also occasionally just be a social event or an elderly person's get-together to socialise and meet new people.


They can view their details in the profile section, along with the events they have registered for and the scheduled date of the event.

The "About Us" section will detail our goals and our dedication to ageing well.

They can contact the team or the administrator by visiting the "contact us" section with any questions.
